#1 use make to compile the program
#2 use ./strfind to run it
#3 when you run it, please note that you should add three params,
	an example ./strfind strpool.dat checkedmail.dat result.dat
	the strpool.dat is the file which we will use to build the trie
	the checkedmail.dat is the file which we should check
	the result.dat is the file which we will write the result
	FYIï¼Œfor reducing the pack of this program, I remove the test data from this pack, so you should copy the test file into this memo.
   and the program will init the input and build the trie and match the strings
   if you have any questions, please contact me. ->boblee0717@gmail.com
